## 🚩 Problem 1: Bonus Marks Based on Attendance

### 📝 Problem Statement
Students receive bonus marks based on attendance:

| Attendance (%)      | Bonus Marks |
|---------------------|-------------|
| More than 95%       | 2           |
| More than 85%       | 1.5         |
| At least 75%        | 1           |
| Less than 75%       | 0           |

### ✅ Task
- Input attendance percentages of 50 students.
- Calculate and store bonus marks in another array.
- Print the **average** bonus marks received.

### 💡 Strategy
- Use two arrays `A[50]` and `B[50]`.
- Use `if-else` to assign bonus marks.
- Loop to calculate average.
